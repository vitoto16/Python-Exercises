"""
Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are
overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt
file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And
yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia.)
